# Wildco Data Sharing Scripts
The Wildco_Occurrence_Data_Multiple_Sites.Rmd script can be used to complete data requests from external parties and find all occurrences of species from projects within the Wildco (Wild3) database

The WildCo_Detections_Data_Sharing script compiles detection data, camera activity periods (accounting for periods of camera obstruction) and deployment info, and project info for specified focal species from camera trap projects in Wild3/Migrations
